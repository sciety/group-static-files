## Our evaluation model

Resources are managed using the FAIR principles that state that all scientific data management and stewardship should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

If you would like to review a manuscript submitted to Gigascience, please review our [open peer-review policy](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/pages/reviewer_guidelines).
